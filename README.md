# APS-Failure-Analysis-Random-Forest-and-XGBoost-with-Class-Imbalance-Compensation
This project features a deep dive into the APS Failure dataset, a rich collection of data from Scania Trucks, highlighting issues in their operational systems. The dataset, renowned for its real-world complexity and class imbalance, serves as an ideal ground for applying advanced machine learning techniques. It includes 60,000 instances with a broad spectrum of 170 features, providing a challenging yet insightful environment for predictive modeling. This analysis not only addresses data preprocessing challenges like missing values but also showcases proficiency in handling imbalanced datasets using Random Forest and XGBoost with L1-penalized logistic regression. The inclusion of SMOTE for class balance further enhances the model's robustness. This project is a testament to skillful data science application in industrial contexts.
